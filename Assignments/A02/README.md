Repl.it is an IDE where programs can be written in many different languages. It is a useful tool for simple programs because
it allows access to programs from any machine. For example, if I write a program using Visual Studio and then later that day i want to 
pull it up on a different computer, then that other machine must have Visual Studio installed. Repl.it is web based so it can be accessed 
anywhere with an internet connection.

Github Desktop makes it easy to interact with Github. It provides a nice UI where the user can click and visualize what they are doing
rather than remember commands and inputting them into a command line. I find that using Github Desktop in conjuction with the command
line improves my work flow.

Jupyter Notebook helps organize a project and make the code more readable, as if it is a pdf. It makes code easy to share and is good
for tutorials because it makes the code seem like an interactive web page.
